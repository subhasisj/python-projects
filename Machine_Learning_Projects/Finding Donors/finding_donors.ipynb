    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "### **Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree Classifiers**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem should conform to the following characteristics for decision trees to be successfully applicable [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances are mostly represented as attribute-value pairs, e.g. Temperatures = {cold, warm}\n",
    "Discrete output values (e.g. income above 50K, below or equal to 50K) One example real-world application is the diagnosis of illnesses based on patient symptoms.\n",
    "Strengths\n",
    "According to [1], decision trees have the following strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are robust to errors in the training data\n",
    "Decision trees are robust to missing attribute values\n",
    "Another advantage is the high interpretability of learning outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "\n",
    "If no pruning is applied, decision trees are very prone to overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees for Donor Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem conforms to the characteristics mentioned above. There are several real-valued attributes, but it's possible to apply decision trees also in these cases by dynamically transforming these attributes in a threshold-based manner to categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forests**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are an ensemble method that is based on multiple decision trees. As we face a classification problem, multiple decision trees will be created at learning time; at prediction time, the mode of the learner's outcomes will be taken as the prediction value.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be interesting to see whether it's possible to increase the classification performance by applying random forests instead of a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications and Strengths**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original paper [2], random forests have been applied for classifying handwritten digits. They can be successfully applied in the same cases as decision trees, but are able to learn more complex rules without being as prone to overfitting as decision trees [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's more difficult to interpret the models learnt compared to the model learnt by a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forests for Donor Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, decision trees can be successfully applied to our problem. It hence is also possible to apply random forests. Assumably, the classification outcomes will be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs have been applied to various domains, e.g. to computer vision tasks in biology [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs can successfully be applied to complicated domains with a clear separating margin [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "\n",
    "Training time of SVMs increases cubicly [3], which means they will perform slowly on large datasets. Noise in the data set might lead to less than optimal results as compared to different algorithms [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "**SVMs for Donor Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is not particularly large, and we should not expect our attributes to be noisy. It's worthwile to examine how well an SVM will perform on our task.\n",

    "To discuss random forests, first let's take a look at how decision trees work. Decision trees are an algorithm that learns to make a decision step by step by looking at the training data. At every step, the algorithm finds the attribute that best separates the donor candidates from the other people in our set. The donors are being represented by the features we expect to be relevant for our problem, e.g. capital gain, age and nationality. For the sake of argument, let's suppose that the age of a person--e.g., person is older than 40--is the best indication of whether they will be donating to CharityML. This means that the algorithm will split the data by age firstly. Now, it finds out which--both for the people that are younger and older--is the next best indication of whether they'll be donating. When the learning is done, we can input the data of a new person to our algorithm; the decision tree will, from top to bottom, compare the attributes of this person to the rules learnt and come up with a decision in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests consist of many decision trees, which allows us to learn more complex rules. Every decision tree will be trained on a subset of our available data--the subsets are created randomly. As every decision tree has only seen a small subset of our total training data, each of them will overfit the training data it has seen. When performing predictions, we let every decision tree take a decision. This way, we counteract the high variance of the single decision trees. It will be decided by vote whether the person probably is a donor or not."

As a second feature, I would choose education, as higher education levels are positively correlated with higher income. Then, I would choose age, as older people earn more than younger people. Income in the countries that have been industrialized early is still higher than in most other parts of the world, so country should have a high importance, even though there are much more people from the US in our data set than from other parts of the world, which negatively effects the impact of this feature.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
